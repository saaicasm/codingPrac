You are given an m x n 2-D integer array matrix and an integer target.

Each row in matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.
The first integer of every row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
Return true if target exists within matrix or false otherwise.

Input: matrix = [[1,2,4,8],[10,11,12,13],[14,20,30,40]], target = 10

Output: true
