a website programming interface an aouthentication system that will accept a password either if its the correct password or if its the correct password with a single character appended to it . In this challenge, your task is to implement such system, spwcifically using hashing function. given the list of events in which either the password is set ot authorization is attempted, determine if each authorizationattempt will be succesful. 
the hashing function will be used in this problem is as followus:
let f(x) be a function that takes a character and returns its decimal character code in the ASCII table. For instance f('a') = 97, g('B')= 66 and f('9')= 57. Then let h(s) be the hashing function that takes a string and hashset it in the following way, where p = 131 and M = 10^9+7:

h(s) := (s[0]*p^(n-1) + s[1]*p^(n-3) + ....... s[n-2]*P + s[n-1]) mod M

for instance, if s = "cAr1", then the formula would be as follows :

h(s) = (f('c')*131^3 + f('A')*131^2 + f('r')*131^1 + f('1')) mod 10^9 + 7 = 223691457

your system will be tested on q event types, each of which will be one of the following:

1. setPassword(s) := sets the password to s
2. authorize(x) := tries to sign in with integer x. This event must return 1 if x is either the hash of the current password or the hash of the current passsword with a single character appended to it. Otherwise, this event must return 0.

consider the following examples .there are 6 events to be handled:
1 setPassword("cAr1")
2 authorize(223691457)
3. authorize(303580761)
4. authorize(100)
5. setPassword("d")
6. authorize(100)

As we know from the above example, h("cAr1") = 223691457, so the second event will return 1. The third event will also return 1 because 303580761 is the hash value of the string "cAr1a", which is equal to the current password with the character 'a' appended to it. The fourth event will return 0 because 100 is not a hash of the current password or of the current password with a single character appended to it. In the fifth event, the current password is set to "d", and the sixth event will return 1 because h("d") = 100. Therefore, the array you would return is [1, 1, 0, 1], corresponding to the success or failure of the authorization events.

Function Description
Complete the function authEvents in the editor below.

authEvents has the following parameter(s):
    string events[q][2]: a 2-dimensional array of strings denoting the event types and event parameters

Returns:
    int[number of authorize events]: an array of integers, either 1 or 0, corresponding to the success (1) or failure (0) of each authorization attempt

Constraints
• 2 ≤ q ≤ 10⁵
• 1 ≤ length of s ≤ 9, where s is a parameter of the setPassword event
• 0 ≤ x ≤ 10⁹+7, where x is the integer value of the parameter of the authorize event
• The first event will always be a setPassword event.
• There will be at least one authorize event.
• s contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters and digits.
